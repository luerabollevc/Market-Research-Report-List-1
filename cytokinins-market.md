<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cytokinins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adenine-type</li><li>Phenylurea-type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cytokinins are plant hormones that play a crucial role in cell division and growth. The market can be divided into two main types: adenine-type and phenylurea-type. Adenine-type cytokinins, derived from adenine, are naturally occurring and promote shoot growth and delay leaf senescence. Phenylurea-type cytokinins, synthetic in nature, enhance cell division and are often more stable in formulations. Both types are widely used in agricultural practices to improve crop yield, quality, and stress resistance in plants.</p></p>
