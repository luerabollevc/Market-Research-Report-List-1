<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power market encompasses three main types of power stations: Dry Steam Stations, Flash Steam Power Stations, and Binary Cycle Stations. Dry Steam Stations utilize steam directly from geothermal reservoirs to generate electricity, making them the simplest method. Flash Steam Power Stations extract high-pressure hot water from the ground, causing it to "flash" into steam as pressure decreases, which then drives turbines. Binary Cycle Stations transfer heat from geothermal fluids to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, creating vapor to generate electricity, allowing for lower temperature resources to be tapped.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal power market primarily consists of three types of power stations: dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle stations. Dry steam stations utilize natural steam from geothermal reservoirs to drive turbines directly. Flash steam power stations extract high-pressure hot water, releasing steam as it rises, which is then used to generate electricity. Binary cycle stations transfer heat from geothermal hot water to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, allowing for efficient energy conversion while maintaining lower environmental impact.</p></p>
