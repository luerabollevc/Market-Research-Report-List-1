<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Millimeter Wave Body Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual</li><li>Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The millimeter wave body scanners market consists of two primary types: manual and automatic scanners. Manual scanners require an operator to oversee the scanning process, ensuring thorough inspections while allowing for human judgment in real-time. In contrast, automatic scanners function independently, utilizing advanced algorithms and imaging technology to detect potential threats without direct operator involvement. Both types enhance security in various settings, including airports and public venues, but differ in terms of operational efficiency and the level of human oversight involved.</p></p>
